# <abbr title="Bootstrap 5.2, Eleventy & Netlify CMS">BEN</abbr> is a easier way to share you projects with others.

This is a solution for those of you that needs a place
to showcase their projects or experience in a certain field without
all the affiliate costs that comes with traditionally blogging solutions like
WorldPress.

## Tech stack:

1. [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/)
2. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)
3. [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/)

## Main advantages:

- Easy to customize the website being build form the ground up with Bootstrap 5.2
- Nice admin panel fully customizable
- With the help of EleventyCMS(<a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/"  >Eleventy Docs</a>) you don't need to touch HTML files every time
  when you are gonna write an article(this is generated by Eleventy)
- You can work very easy in teams if you want.
- You aren't vendor locked. EleventyCMS its an open source project that let you deploy anywhere,but for a better integration I recommend using GitHub and Netlify PaaS.
- In the admin panel you can write the article using the rich text editor or if you already know [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you can use that.

## Admin Panel

<img style="width:75%; height:auto;" class="img-fluid p-1" src=" /assets/img/adminPanel(Demo).jpg" />

In the image above it's an example of a fully configured admin panel where you can create articles, edit the site settings and the Workflow tab that allow you do review the article before you are gonna make it public. [Here](https://cms-demo.netlify.com/) is a demo of the admin panel.

## Adding new posts

All the field that appear below can be configure from /src/admin/config.yml.Putting this out of the way some of the options of the fields that doesn't appear below are: lists, map, color and code.<a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/" >Read more</a>

## Customizing

At this moment you can change the navbar links and the branding.

## Run locally

Clone the project on local machine

```bash
  git clone  https://github.com/BlitzStudio/blog-template.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the Netlify Cms Server. It' s required for the local admin panel.

```bash
  npx eleventy-cms-proxy-server
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run serve
```

Start coding

```bash
  code .
```

The web server will run on <a href="http://localhost:8080" >localhost</a> and you can find the admin panel <a href="http://localhost:8080/admin"  >here</a>.

**If you are satisfied with the changes made you can push the changes to your Github fork and then deploy to Netlify.**

## Deployment

I am gonna present the Netlify way because this is my preferred one because comes with GitHub authentication, but as I said you can deploy anywhere and to secure the /admin endpoint you can use Cloudflare Zero Trust platform to achieve enhance security.

1. Fork the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/BlitzStudio/blog-template)
2. Clone the project on your local machine
3. Make the required changes, until you are satisfied with the changes
4. Remove that line from /src/admin/config.yml(line 10) before pushing the changes to your fork.

```bash
local_backend: true
```

5. Add a new site on the [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/):
   1. Chose you git provider and import the project.
   2. Go on the site settings and Enable Identity and then enable the Git Gateway.Optionally you can enable an external provider like GitHub to login on the admin panel with that.
